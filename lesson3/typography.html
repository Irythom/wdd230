    <h2>Heading Font</h2>
    <p>
      I have chosen Montserrat due to it being a neat, clean, and very legible
      font to read. I enjoy things that are nice and simplistic, and modern,
      without too many frills attached. This gives off a very professional
      appearance.
    </p>
    <h2>Paragraph Font</h2>
    I have chosen Montserrat for the same reasons as previously stated. I
    thought long and hard about what font would go well with Montserrat as a
    paragraph font, and the more options I looked at the less visually appealing
    they were. I then took a look at a couple of websites. Specifically Apple,
    and mejuri. Both websites are very successful, aesthetically pleasing,
    websites that I have heard compliments on from friends and family. In fact,
    I specifcially asked friends and family about their favorite websites to
    navigate and these were the top two. I believe that replicating this single
    font will allow me to similarly provide a pleasing user experience.
    <h2>Paragraph Example</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this organization is for the local businesses and
      individuals of Eagle Mountain to band together, businesses creating
      opportunities to give back to the community, and the community creating
      opportunities to give back to the businesses. As Eagle Mountain bands
      together to accomplish one goal, we can work towards developing our city
      in the way that we as the people of Eagle Mountain would like. We can make
      the changes we want and need, and can grow in ways that wouldn't be
      possible without the support we can receive from eachother!
