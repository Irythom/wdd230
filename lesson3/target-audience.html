    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p> 
      The two main group of members that this chamber of commerce is supposed to
      reach are somewhat talked about on the main page: local businesses and
      individuals of Eagle Mountain.</p>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>
      The personas listed below are ficticous examples of people who may be interested
      in viewing Eagle Mountain's chamber of commerce website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Dearden; Owner of local shop named Quench it: At 43 years old, Joe Dearden has
      just opened a local shop where he sells a variety of custom ordered drinks. He is 
      a hardworker, who singlehandedly started the shop all on his own. However, due to 
      very few connections to the community, as of yet no one has shown interest in his
      new shop. He is looking for somewhere to connect him with others around him, and is 
      looking to receive some support and advice in his new endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Benedict; Local resident: Alan is just your average neighbor. At 45 years old, 
      he has a family of 5, a stable job, and is quite content with where he lives. A generous
      guy at heart, he is one to buy girlscout cookies not for the cookies themselves, but to help
      those girlscouts out in the way that he can.  Alan absolutely loves to socialize, and is all
      for making new friends. He has been looking for community events to attend, so that he can 
      continue to meet more people.
