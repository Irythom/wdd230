          I feel as if this page properly uses Visual Hierarchy due to the
          visual cleanliness of the site and the arrangement of each of the
          items on it. It organized things in order of importance, having all of
          the important links to navigate the site up at the top, with
          appropriate images to pull you in just below, ordered neatly left to
          right, top to bottom, with proper sizing. It follows exactly where the
          user's eyes want to trace. It is properly split up into sections such
          as every day jewelry, valentines day gifts, etc.

        <p>
          I threw this one under rule of thirds due to their use of spacing,
          dividing the first third of the website to the important words and
          details that they would like you to read and notice, and the other two
          thirds for supporting images and things of the like. If you scroll
          down to the second set of images, you'll see a portion that says, "New
          year, clean slate..." I feel as if this is a perfect example of how to
          split the space of your website properly into thirds.

        <p>
          Urban Outfitters properly uses white, negative spacing in order to
          differentiate and divide between images, links, typography, and
          products. This allows for the eyes to easily jump from object to
          object, without any fear of missing something in a blur of different
          objects on the page. In fact, nothing passes the eyes unseen.
